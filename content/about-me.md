Hi :wave:, I'm Ralf!

I am a passionate open-source enthusiast at heart :sparkling_heart:. I have been advocating for
the use of open-source software for decades. My passion began in the pre-2000 years with the
[Debian GNU/Linux](https://debian.org) project and the [Chaos Computer Club](https://ccc.de).
I have enjoyed kickstarting the local [Freifunk community](https://freifunk-kreisgt.de) in my area
as well as promoting other projects that are close to the ideals of NGO and open-source communities.

Professionally, I am now a Lead Architect at [SAP](https://www.sap.com) :briefcase:, focusing
on the architecture and technology of the SAP RISE Cloud offering. Although I’ve stepped out of
the front line of building sovereign clouds, I remain deeply engaged with the European sovereign 
cloud ecosystem - these days, contributing more quietly from behind the scenes.

Before joining SAP, I spent many years at [plusserver gmbh](https://plusserver.com/), where I had
the privilege of helping to build the [pluscloud open](https://www.plusserver.com/en/products/pluscloud-open)
- a 100% open-source cloud — from the ground up. 

As part of this work, I contributed to the [Open Operations Manifesto](https://openoperations.org/)  
and worked closely with the [Sovereign Cloud Stack](https://sovereigncloudstack.org/) community :rocket:.

Nowadays, in my spare time, I am mostly a dad of three :angel:. And let's just say, I've surpassed
the age of *42* :older_man:, but I'm still not sure if it's the answer to *the Ultimate Question of Life,  
the Universe, and Everything* (as per the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) - but I’ll keep searching for it.

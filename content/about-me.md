Hi, I'm Ralf!

I am a passionate open source enthusiast at heart. I have been advocating for the use of open
source software for decades. My passion began in the pre-2000 years with the Debian GNU/Linux
project. I have enjoyed kickstarting the Freifunk community in my area as well as promoting
other projects that are close to the free and open-source software communities.

I've been working for [PlusServer GmbH](https://plusserver.com) on and off for 2 decades
now, currently being part of the team building the 100% open source cloud called [pluscloud
open](https://www.plusserver.com/en/products/pluscloud-open).

Nowadays, in my spare time, I am mostly a dad of three. Also, I have surpassed "certain
age" and let's just say, I'm pretty sure the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life,
The Universe, and Everything is not 42, but I'll continue my search for it.

Hi :wave:, I'm Ralf!

I am a passionate open-source enthusiast at heart :sparkling_heart:. I have been advocating for
the use of open-source software for decades. My passion began in the pre-2000 years with the
[Debian GNU/Linux](https://debian.org) project and the [Chaos Computer Club](https://ccc.de).
I have enjoyed kickstarting the local Freifunk community in [my area](https://freifunk-kreisgt.de)
as well as promoting other projects that are close to ideals of NGO and open-source communities.

Nowadays, in my spare time, I am mostly a dad of three :angel:. And let's just say, I've surpassed
the age of *42* :older_man:, but I'm still not sure if it's the answer to _the Ultimate Question
of Life, The Universe, and Everything_ (as per the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) but I'll
continue my search for it.

I've been working for [PlusServer GmbH](https://plusserver.com/) :briefcase: on and off for
2 decades now, currently being part of the team building the 100% open-source cloud called
[pluscloud open](https://www.plusserver.com/en/products/pluscloud-open) :rocket:. Recently,
I had the pleasure of co-authoring the [Open Operations Manifesto](https://openoperations.org/)
as part of the [Sovereign Cloud Stack](https://scs.community) community.

## Ralf Heiringhoff

Hi, I'm Ralf! I am a passionate open source enthusiast at heart. I have been advocating
for the use of open source software for decades. My passion began in the pre-2000 years
with the Debian GNU/Linux project. I have enjoyed kickstarting the Freifunk community in my
area as well as promoting other projects that are close to the free and open-source software
communities. I've been working for [PlusServer GmbH](https://plusserver.com) on and off for
2 decades now, currently being part of the team building the 100% open source cloud called
[pluscloud open](https://www.plusserver.com/en/products/pluscloud-open).
Nowadays, in my spare time, I am mostly a dad of three.
